Sylvie Cazalens (http://www.sylvie-cazalens.fr), associate professor in Computer Science at University of Lyon and she is a member of the database group at LIRIS. Her research is about large scale distributed data sharing systems. These systems consist of autonomous participating sources that manage their structured and/or unstructured data on their own and that compute their local answers to incoming queries. She has applied this paradigm in a peer-to-peer (P2P) context, where each peer is a data source. She has particularly focussed on: data integration and data mediation, semantic interoperability among peers, with adaptation of the answer to the query initiator, semantic heterogeneity of a system, including definitions of it and gossiping algorithms to reduce it, dissimilarities between descriptions of data sources, in particular topic-based ones. She uses concepts, algorithms and techniques from several fields, ranging from Databases and Information Retrieval to Distributed Systems and Semantic Web.
