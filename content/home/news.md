  The network will interact to reason about the following objectives:

- **Objective 1 (O1): Acquired data, models and knowledge integration**
- **Objective 2 (O2): Curation, maintenance, exploration of data collections** 
- **Objective 3 (O3): Modelling and simulating experiments to answer questions in geoscience and make timely decisions**

**Coordination actions**

**(CA1-CA2)**      Summit  & Thematic School on intelligent data-centric geosciences (hybrid 4 days event)

**(CA3)**       Kaggle challenges in (2)

**(CA4)** Agenda on intelligent data-centric geosciences **white paper**

**(CA5-CA6)**      2 scientific visit 15 days (FR <-> BR) / 2 PhD internship of 12 months (1 Brazil -> France)

**(CA7)**       Proposal for a scientific project of data-centric intelligent geosciences (ANR or CAPES-COFECUB or IRN) 

 

**Scientific**

**(S1) Geoscience Brazilian data curation portal** with exploration tools including examples of applications and analytics results  (GitHub for encouraging reproducible experiments)

**(S2) Use case statements** with geosciences questions and associated data descriptions and inhouse experiments.

**(S3) Position Paper** about intelligent geosciences using data science methods.
