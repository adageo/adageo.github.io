The objective of the international network is to create a French - Brazilian International Emerging Action on Data-Centred Intelligent GeoSciences (IEA) to promote scientific cooperation and exchange between French and Brazilian researchers interested in the design and implementation of large-scale data centric Earth Science experiments. Initially, the project will focus on solid earth data (passive seismology mostly) but the framework can be expanded to other earth science data observations.

ADAGEO will be to develop and reason about best practices and novel ways of curating data-centric geosciences knowledge (data, experiments, models, methods, conclusions, and interpretations) produced from the application of statistical modelling, machine learning, and modern data analytics methods on geo data collections, e.g., Spatio-temporal modelling, probabilistic modelling, and uncertainty quantification; open methodological questions in model building, model assessment, prediction, and forecasting workflows.
